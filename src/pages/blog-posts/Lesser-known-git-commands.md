There's a lot of excellent git tutorials on the web, such as [this excellent one](https://learngitbranching.js.org/). I don't know about you but there's only a handful of git commands I use in my day to day. Ergo, there's likely numerous helpful commands I don't know.

This document is a way for me to keep track of a bunch of git commands that I may not use frequently but still find helpful. I hope you may find this document helpful as well!

### Writing a multi-line git commit message

Use the `-m` flag multiple times in your git commit message to include.

```git
git commit -m "first comment" -m "second comment"
```

This does the same thing as pressing enter on your terminal after typing:

```git
git commit -m "
> first comment
> second comment
> "
```

### git describe

This isn't a command I used at all until I started my full-time job as a software engineer and even then, I only started using it after a coworker showed me how:

```git

```

#### git stash

```git

```
